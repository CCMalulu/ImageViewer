# Image Viewer and Tonemapper

An image viewer for anyone related to computer graphics. It supports quick side-by-side comparison, arithmetic image manipulation, customisable filter effects (HLSL) and 360Â° views.

## File Formats

Currently the following image formats can be imported:
* PNG, JPG, BMP
* HDR, PFM
* uncompressed DDS, KTX
* block compression (BC1-BC7) for DDS, KTX
* EXR

Exporting is supported for:
* PNG, JPG, BMP
* HDR, PFM
* KTX, DDS (uncompressed and block compression)

[Used Libraries](about.md)

## Download

System Requirements:
- x64 bit
- .Net 4.6.1
- DirextX 11 compatible graphics card

Version 3.1 x64 Windows: [Download](https://github.com/kopaka1822/ImageViewer/raw/Release/Build/ImageViewer3_1.zip)

## View Modes
### Simple Images
The status bar displays the current texture coordinates (cursor) along with the corresponding RGBA color values in linear color space. The display type can be changed from linear color space to Srgb color space via: View->Pixel Display->Format.

### Images with multiple mipmaps and faces

Select a specific mipmap level and layer (face) of DDS and KTX textures and view cubemaps in projection or crossview:

### Lat-Long Polar Images

View the raw polar image or look around in polar mode:

## Side By Side Comparision and Image Manipulation

Compare up to 4 images side by side and use custom formulas to modify the displayed result. Additionally you can use the + and - Key to adjust the exposure.

I0 and I1 are the pixels from the first and the second image. sRGB values are in range [0,1] and you can combine them with following operators: * + - / ^. Numerical constants can be used as well. The detailed image equation guide can be found [here](equation.md).

## Custom HLSL Compute Shader Filter

Filter are HLSL compute shader that can be imported by the ImageViewer. Only a single function needs to be implemented that will be called for each pixel of the image. User defined parameters can be set from within the GUI. Some filter, like the gaussian blur, are already implemented and can be imported via the filter tab:

An example for a simple gamma correction filter would look like this:

```hlsl
// general information about the shader
#setting title, Gamma Correction
#setting description, Nonlinear operation used to encode and decode luminance.

// define displayed name, variable name (for the shader), variable type, default value and optional minmum, maximum
#param Gamma, gamma, float, 1, 0
#param Factor, factor, float, 1.0, 0

// this function will be called once for each pixel
float4 filter(int2 pixelCoord, int2 size)
{
	float4 color = src_image[pixelCoord];

	const float invGamma = 1.0 / gamma;
	color.rgb = pow(abs(color.rgb * factor), float3(invGamma, invGamma, invGamma));
	
	return color;
}
```

The detailed filter guide can be found [here](filter_manual.md).
